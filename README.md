wflow2pepa
==========

The **wflow2pepa** (workflow to PEPA) application program may be used
to model performance of hierarchical workflow systems using the
[Performance Evaluation Process Algebra
(PEPA)](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/pepa/). To use this application,
the user provides a description file (see examples in 
`examples` sub-directory) by using a hierarchical pattern specification
language. From this specification, the application generates the
corresponding PEPA performance model automatically. See `QAPL2007.pdf`
for further details.

## History

I wrote this program in 2006~2007, while I was a
[post-doc](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/enhance/) at the
[School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk), [University of
Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/).
